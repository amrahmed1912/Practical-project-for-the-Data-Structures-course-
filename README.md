# Practical-project-for-the-Data-Structures-course
## Project Overview
<p>
  This is a C++ console-based project that allows users to interact with and manage several fundamental data structures, including Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues. The project provides a simple menu-driven interface to perform common operations like insertion, deletion, and display of elements.  
</p>

## Project Structure
<p>
  main.cpp – Contains the full program including implementations for Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue, and the main menu system.
</p>
  
## Classes Implemented 
<p>
  Array – Fixed-size array with insert, delete, and display functions.<br>
  LinkedList – Singly linked list with insert, delete, and display functions.<br>
  Stack – Stack implemented using an array.<br>
  Queue – Queue implemented using an array.<br>
</p>

## Learning Outcomes
<p>
  Understanding of fundamental data structures and their operations.<br>
  Practice with manual memory management (new and delete in Linked Lists).<br>
  Strengthened knowledge of C++ programming, including arrays, pointers, and class design.<br>
