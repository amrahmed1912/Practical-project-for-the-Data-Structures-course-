## - Project Title  
**Data Structure Management Program (Array – Linked List – Stack – Queue) Using C++**

---

## - Project Introduction  
This project is an interactive console application that allows users to work with the most common basic data structures and perform essential operations on them, such as insertion, deletion, and display.

The project aims to understand how to manually construct these structures using pointers and functions, and how to design an interactive program that integrates multiple data structures into a single interface.

## - Project Objectives  
- Practical application of data structures: **Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue**.  
- Implementation of basic operations for each data structure.  
- Practice using classes and organizing code across separate header and source files.  
- Understanding how to build a **main menu** with structured **submenus** for user interaction.

## - Learning Outcomes

 - Understanding of fundamental data structures and their operations.<br>
 - Practice with manual memory management (new and delete in Linked Lists).<br>
 - Strengthened knowledge of C++ programming, including arrays, pointers, and class design.<br>
